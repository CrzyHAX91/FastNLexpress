# Setting Up a Staging Environment for Dropship V2

This guide outlines the process of setting up a staging environment for the Dropship V2 project. A staging environment allows you to test changes in a production-like setting before deploying to the live site.

## Prerequisites

- A separate server or hosting environment for staging (e.g., a separate Heroku app)
- Access to a staging database (can be a separate database on the same server as production)

## Steps to Set Up Staging

1. Clone the repository on your staging server
2. Create a new branch for staging
3. Set up environment variables for staging
4. Install dependencies
5. Run database migrations
6. Collect static files
7. Set up a process manager (e.g., Gunicorn) to run the application
8. Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx) to serve the application

## Deploying to Staging

1. Push changes to the staging branch
2. On your staging server, pull the changes
3. Restart your application server

## Testing in Staging

- Perform thorough testing of all features in the staging environment
- Test with a copy of production data (be sure to anonymize sensitive information)
- Verify that all third-party integrations work correctly in the staging environment

## Promoting Staging to Production

1. Merge the staging branch into main
2. Deploy the main branch to your production environment

Remember to always test thoroughly in staging before deploying to production.
